        <h1>Understanding HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h1>
        
        <!-- What is HTML section -->
        <section>
            <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
            <p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. Think of it as the skeleton or foundation of every website you visit. HTML uses elements (tags) to structure content and tell the browser what each piece of content represents.</p>
            
            <p>HTML stands for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HyperText:</strong> Text that contains links to other text or media</li>
                <li><strong>Markup:</strong> A system of annotating text to indicate its structure</li>
                <li><strong>Language:</strong> A set of rules and syntax for creating web documents</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Every webpage starts with HTML - it's like the blueprint that defines what content goes where. Without HTML, there would be no structure, no headings, no paragraphs, and no way for browsers to understand how to display information.</p>
        </section>
        
        <!-- What you're seeing section -->
        <section>
            <h2>What you're seeing: HTML in action</h2>
            <p>Right now, you're looking at pure HTML with absolutely no styling or interactivity. This is what the web looked like in the early 1990s! Notice how:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Everything is displayed in the browser's default font (usually Times New Roman)</li>
                <li>There are no colors except the default black text on white background</li>
                <li>Links appear in blue and turn purple when visited</li>
                <li>The content flows from top to bottom in the order it appears in the code</li>
                <li>Headings automatically appear larger and bolder than regular text</li>
                <li>Lists are automatically indented with bullet points</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This demonstrates HTML's core purpose: <em>structuring and organizing content</em> so browsers know what each element is supposed to be.</p>

        <!-- Key Features section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Key HTML Features Demonstrated</h2>
            <p>This simple webpage showcases several fundamental HTML elements:</p>
            
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>&lt;header&gt;</strong></dt>
                <dd>Defines the top section of the page containing introductory content</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>&lt;main&gt;</strong></dt>
                <dd>Contains the primary content of the document</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>&lt;section&gt;</strong></dt>
                <dd>Groups related content together thematically</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;</strong></dt>
                <dd>Create headings of different importance levels</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong></dt>
                <dd>Defines paragraphs of text</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>&lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt;</strong></dt>
                <dd>Create unordered (bulleted) lists</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>&lt;dl&gt;, &lt;dt&gt;, &lt;dd&gt;</strong></dt>
                <dd>Create definition lists (like this one!)</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;</strong></dt>
                <dd>Add emphasis and importance to text</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong></dt>
                <dd>Creates hyperlinks (you'll see one in the footer)</dd>
            </dl>
            
            <p>Each of these elements has semantic meaning - they tell both browsers and assistive technologies (like screen readers) what the content represents, not just how it should look.</p>

        <!-- Learning section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Why Start with HTML?</h2>
            <p>HTML is the foundation because:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Proper HTML structure makes websites usable by everyone, including people with disabilities</li>
                <li><strong>SEO:</strong> Search engines rely on HTML structure to understand and rank content</li>
                <li><strong>Semantic meaning:</strong> HTML gives meaning to content beyond just appearance</li>
                <li><strong>Universal compatibility:</strong> HTML works on every device and browser</li>
                <li><strong>Progressive enhancement:</strong> You can add CSS and JavaScript later, but HTML must come first</li>
            </ol>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p>"HTML is like the foundation of a house - without it, nothing else can be built properly. CSS is the paint and decorations, JavaScript is the electricity and plumbing, but HTML is what holds it all together."</p>
